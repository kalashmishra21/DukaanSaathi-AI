# Phase 8 verification

## Local checks completed

- Lint, typecheck and production build pass; 57 tests across 9 files pass.
- Local Postgres tests cover purchase-order validation, receipt transitions, stock movements, repeated-receipt rejection, owner isolation and anonymous rejection.
- Playwright checked Assistant, Inventory, Khata and Sales at desktop and 390 px mobile widths. No horizontal overflow or page runtime errors were observed.
- Connected Assistant reads verified stock, khata and daily sales; a shopping-list draft showed availability and prices without creating a sale.
- Inventory/customer search and sales empty-state filters passed.
- Secret scan of tracked and nonignored candidate files found no local credentials. `.env.local`, tool state, dependencies and build output remain ignored.
- The project Impeccable hook is configured in the ignored `.codex/hooks.json`. Its Windows PostToolUse and Stop commands each exit 0 when invoked from the repository root. The earlier exit 1 has no retained diagnostic trace, and it did not reproduce; the hook remains enabled.

## Design tools used

Existing installations were reused. DESIGN.md remains authoritative.

| Tool | Applied guidance |
| --- | --- |
| Impeccable 4.5.0 | Independent critiques, typography/layout review and polish: inline verified results, less technical copy, compact mobile navigation. Final UI detector returned no findings. |
| Taste v2 / design-taste-frontend | Charcoal command center, ivory reading surfaces and restrained copper hierarchy. |
| Emil animate / review-animations | Short result-entry motion, no bounce, reduced-motion support. |
| UI UX Pro Max (CLI 2.15.0) | Typography/reference audit; retained Manrope/Newsreader, clarified heading/control/data roles. |
| Vercel React best practices | Parallel independent reads, cached shop context, server-rendered pages and no added frontend dependencies. |
| Playwright CLI 0.1.22 | Desktop/mobile screenshots, interaction checks and production navigation sample. |

Before/after screenshots are outside Git in `%TEMP%/ds-phase8/`: `assistant-before-desktop.png`, `assistant-before-mobile.png`, `assistant-after-desktop.png`, `assistant-after-mobile.png`, plus Inventory/Khata/Sales, Overview/Orders and Assistant result views.

A single local prefetched Inventory-to-Assistant navigation sample measured 940 ms in development and 100 ms in production. These are sanity checks, not a repeatable benchmark; initial inventory load was slower in the production sample. Three.js remains confined to the landing experience.

## Live merchant checks

The project owner confirmed `20261008190000_suppliers_purchase_orders.sql` is live on project `oaafyctyvxbnmzhftsix`; it was not reapplied. The app loaded both seeded demo suppliers. A synthetic QA supplier was created, edited and verified after reload. A reorder suggestion created a 10-unit Amul Milk draft; placing it left stock at 10. Receiving it changed stock to 20 and wrote one `+10` movement. A repeated receipt request returned HTTP 422 with a safe message and stock remained 20. An Assistant command saved a Maggi purchase-order draft, which was visible after reload; cancelling it left Maggi stock at 46.

Assistant `inventory.getReorderSuggestions`, `supplier.list`, `supplier.create`, `orders.getOpen` and `orders.createDraft` returned results from the connected shop. Repeating a supplier creation produced “Action not completed,” not a success claim. Inventory search by SKU and low-stock filter, customer search and Rahul Sharma's ₹300 ledger, sales payment/date filters, and overview recent stock/order activity were checked against the live app. Desktop and 390 px mobile Overview, Orders and Assistant showed no horizontal overflow.

`20261008190256_purchase_order_items_shop_index.sql` is a separate follow-up migration. It passes the local PostgreSQL migration test and has not been applied to the hosted project. The application does not depend on this performance index to function.
